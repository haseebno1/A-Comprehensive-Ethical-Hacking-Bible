<summary><b>🔍 What is Ethical Hacking?</b></summary>
<br>
Ethical hacking involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. It's among the most exciting IT jobs any person can have. You're literally getting paid to keep up with the latest technology and break into computer systems and applications!

Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers act with permission from the system owners and work to improve security postures rather than exploit them for personal gain.
